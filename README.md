# Burger Town

### Problem the app addresses
This app allows you to enter a hamburger name and update the database to store that new name. It then allows you to change the status of that hamburger to devoured and change it to a separate list on the webpage.

### How the app is layed out
The app has essentially three separate functionalities to it. It has a create functionality where the user can input a new hamburger name. It has a read functionality where the user can see which hamburger names have been created. The third functionality is an update. The user can select the "Devour It" button and it will update the database to show that the hamburger has been devoured.

### Instructions on running the app
1. The user can click on the create a burger name box and type whatever name they would like. They can then select the create button to add it to the list of burgers created.
2. The user can then select the devour button by any of the listed names to move it over to the devoured list on the right.

### Technologies used
* Node.js used to test server connection and install packages.
* MVC to organize the files.
* Express.js to set up the different routes
* MySql to set up a database to store and update the information inputted.
* Handlebars used to render the html page.

#### My Role
I created this from start to finish. I used past examples of code from our class and researched a lot on my own.
